# QFinance V2 Lending Protocol

This series of contracts enables lending and borrowing functionalities similar to Compound or Cream. These contracts were built from scratch
and are unique; they are not forked from Compound.

## Contracts

Documentation coming soon...

## NOTE

Cream was recently hacked for $130M. The QFinance team is reviewing this hack to see if our solution is similarly vulnerable. Please do not use these contracts until this review is complete.
